## Introduction

In the world nowadays, there is a bunch of charitable behavior internationally and domestically. The behavior of charity includes three different kinds of them, people volunteer their time, people who help stranger and people who donate to charity. However, the different behaviors are influenced by the country they live in since the different country has a different level of development. It is important to know the charitable behaviors of each country.

## Objectives

The major aim of the project is to visualize the statistics of the homicide reports, which includes more than 22,000 homicides. The homicide reports will be analyzed by the states the homicide happed at, the sex and the ethnicity of the perpetrator and victim, the weapon and also the relationship between the suspect and the victim. From the statistical results, it is clear to realize which states may have a gap in the law to make the homicides happened easily, which sex and race may have the higher potential becoming the perpetrator. Furthermore, the result will show us what kind of relationship could contain a higher crisis. The data for completing this project is compiled and made available by the Murder Accountability Project, founded by Thomas Hargrove.
